## Note:

Resistors R1, R2, R6, of the logic board should be changed, the **actual** current limits will be less than whats listed in the schematic.

The Keyswitch PCB still only has one via connecting VCC to all LED's. At extremely high current the via may fail. The circumference of the via is 24.7369mil, assuming 0.5oz copper plating, this should be able to handle 1.6A at a 30C rise from ambient (25C).

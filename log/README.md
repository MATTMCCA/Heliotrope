# Log

The wenext SLA Print came out nice, there was minimal warping to the case. However the slim top piece is unusable. This is my fault for not fulling understanding the properties of the material. A revision is in my near future.

The PCB's came out perfect, all of the footprints match as I had hoped, and all the though hole mounted LED's have room. Both types of sockets fit the same footprint, so that's good news.

I'm still waiting on my SLA prints from another fab, I'm curious to see how they compare in quality vs price.

I'm also still waiting on my steel plate, once I have everything in front of me, I can tweak away.

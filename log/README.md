# Log

The wenext SLA Print came out nice, there was minimal warping to the case. However the slim top piece is unusable. This is my fault for not fully understanding the properties of the material. A revision is in my near future.

The PCB's came out perfect, all of the footprints match as I had hoped, and all the though hole mounted LED's have room. Both types of sockets fit the same footprint, so that's good news.

I'm also still waiting on my steel plate, once I have everything in front of me, I can tweak away.

I got my SLA prints from JLCPCB, they look great. I did a test assembly, and everything fits so far. I did notice warping in the back, presumably due **the lack of screw** ( omitted, but shouldn't of been, symmetry is your friend ).  See photos 003 - 009, I may not need to revise the case, other than the addition of a screw.

# Log 002

I got my second batch of "imagine black" SLA resin parts from wenext. I think I'm just going to brace the top frame with 2mm cross members, and run a third batch of cases in 3201PA-F Nylon (JLCPCB). This is a last ditch effort to print a case, without a complete case redesign. OH! I also got my switch plate from ponoko the other day, its perfect (see repo photos).

So, I left the PCB Floating, this means any force pulling the PCB in the up direction will encounter ZERO resistance.  Laterally everything is fine, but I really should have mounted the PCB. "Why don't I just fix it?" you ask yourself. Well, that would be easy... had I not already sent the files to fab...... So now the question is, can I Jerry rig some kind of spacer? or should I just bite the bullet and fix the case? Stayed tuned for the not so epic conclusion of the auto-mono-log.
